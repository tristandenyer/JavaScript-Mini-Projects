# Image hover exercise

Practice space for customizing the Bootstrap figure and figcaption to swap out the text on hover. Storing the original figcaption text in sessionStorage.

## Goals of this project

In keeping with always learning, this exercise explores:

- styling the Bootstrap figure to move the figcaption to be on top of the image
- swapping out the figcaption text to become a CTA on mouseover
- replacing CTA with orignal text on mouseout
- not using a show/hide method on hover
- not relying on a bunch of extra figcaptions in every figure
- having only one place to update mouseover CTAs for each figcaption
