# Ajax exercise

Practice space for making HTTP requests using Ajax.

## Goals of this project

In keeping with always learning, this exercise explores:

- making an Ajax HTTP request via `XMLHttpRequest()`
- calculating the time it takes to receive request (TODO: improve accuracy)
- storing all past request times in sessionStorage (manipulating as an array)
- retrieve from sessionStorage and printing
- calculating the average of all values stored in sessionStorage array
- comparing prvious load time with latest loadtime and dislaying it as improved (green), same (gray), or declined (red)

## Future improvements

- add a reload button (and calculate `start_time` on click?)
- improved typography of dashboard values
- graph the historical timestamps
- add dropdown for choosing different JSON endpoints
