                It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of a
                poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long Vaticans
                and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random allusions to
                whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever, sacred or profane.
                Therefore you must not, in every case at least, take the
                higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in these
                extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As touching the
                ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here appearing, these
                extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording a glancing
                bird's eye view of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied,
                and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our
                own.

                but with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel poor-devilish, too;
                and grow convivial upon tears; and say to them bluntly, with full eyes
                and empty glasses, and in not altogether unpleasant sadness&mdash;Give
                it up, Sub-Subs! For by how much the more pains ye take to please the
                world, by so much the more shall ye for ever go thankless! Would that I
                could clear out Hampton Court and the Tuileries for ye! But gulp down
                your tears and hie aloft to the royal-mast with your hearts; for your
                friends who have gone before are clearing out the seven-storied heavens,
                and making refugees of long-pampered Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael,
