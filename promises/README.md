# Promises exercise

Practice space for using promises when making HTTP requests using Ajax.

## Goals of this project

In keeping with always learning, this exercise explores:

- using a promise when making an HTTP request
- logging steps with timestamp (sidebar)
- error and negative logs in logger get special styling
- extending upon [other Ajax project](https://github.com/tristandenyer/JavaScript-Mini-Projects/tree/master/http-requests/ajax "see Ajax project")
- allowing user to clear historical timestamps from sessionStorage
